# ðŸš— Gesture-Controlled Robotic Car

This project demonstrates a hand gesture-controlled robotic car using an MPU6050 sensor and Bluetooth communication. By detecting tilt-based gestures from the user's hand, the system sends wireless commands to control the movement of the car in real time.

When the hand is tilted forward, backward, left, or right, the car moves in the corresponding direction. The project uses Arduino boards and basic robotics to create a simple and intuitive human-machine interaction system.

This is a fun and interactive way to explore embedded systems, motion sensing, and wireless control.
